# OffTimes Android App Version 1.3.4 Update Notes

## Release Date: 2025-09-19

## üö® Critical Fix: App Switching Detection

- **Fixed App Switching Detection Delay Issue**:
  - **Root Cause**: The `UnifiedUpdateService` was using a 60-second interval for event pulling, meaning app switches (like OffTimes ‚Üí Chrome) could take up to 60 seconds to be detected. This caused the state machine to remain "stuck" on the previous app.
  - **Impact**: When users switched from OffTimes to Chrome, the system continued to record OffTimes usage for up to 60 seconds until the next event pull cycle, leading to false usage records.
  - **Fix**: Modified `performQuickActiveAppsUpdate()` to also pull events every 10 seconds, ensuring app switches are detected within 10 seconds instead of 60 seconds.
  - **Code Change**:
    ```kotlin
    // Before: Quick updates only updated active app duration, no event pulling
    // After: Quick updates now include event pulling for timely app switch detection
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `app/src/main/java/com/offtime/app/service/UnifiedUpdateService.kt`
- **Method**: `performQuickActiveAppsUpdate()` - Lines 237-257
- **Update Intervals**:
  - **Complete Update**: Every 60 seconds (unchanged)
  - **Quick Update with Event Pull**: Every 10 seconds (NEW - now includes event pulling)
- **Version**: Updated to v1.3.4 (versionCode: 26)

## üîß How It Works Now

1. **Every 10 seconds**: Pull latest events + update active apps (Quick Update)
2. **Every 60 seconds**: Full data aggregation + UI refresh (Complete Update)
3. **Result**: App switches are detected within 10 seconds maximum

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. Install v1.3.4 on your device
2. Open OffTimes, then switch to Chrome
3. Check logcat - you should see Chrome startup events being detected within 10 seconds
4. Verify that OffTimes usage stops accumulating after switching to Chrome

## üìã Expected Behavior

- **Before**: App switches took up to 60 seconds to detect
- **After**: App switches detected within 10 seconds
- **Result**: Accurate usage tracking with minimal delay

**Note**: This fix addresses the state machine "stuck" issue where the service continued to record the previous app's usage after switching to a new app.
